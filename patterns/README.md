# Creational Patterns
1. **Abstract Factory** Creates an instance of several families of classes
2. **Builder** Separates object construction from its representation
3. **Factory** Method Creates an instance of several derived classes
4. **Prototype** A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
5. **Singleton** A class of which only a single instance can exist

# Structural Patterns
1. **Adapter** Match interfaces of different classes
2. **Bridge** Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
3. **Composite**	A tree structure of simple and composite objects
4. **Decorator**	Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
5. **Facade** A single class that represents an entire subsystem
6. **Flyweight** A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
7. **Proxy** An object representing another object

# Behavioral Patterns
1. **Chain of Resp.** A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
2. **Command** Encapsulate a command request as an object
3. **Interpreter** A way to include language elements in a program
4. **Iterator** Sequentially access the elements of a collection
5. **Mediator** Defines simplified communication between classes
6. **Memento** Capture and restore an object's internal state
7. **Observer** A way of notifying change to a number of classes
8. **State** Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
9. **Strategy** Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
10. **Template** Method	Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
11. **Visitor** Defines a new operation to a class without change
